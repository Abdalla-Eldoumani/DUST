# Starting Prompt for Claude Code (Plan Mode)

You are building **DUST**, a hackathon project for Calgary Hacks 2026. Read the following files in this exact order before doing ANYTHING:

1. `CLAUDE.md` (root) — project overview, architecture, design system, game design document
2. `TASKS.md` — your ordered task list, check off items as you complete them
3. `apps/web/CLAUDE.md` — frontend architecture
4. `apps/web/src/CLAUDE.md` — source structure and conventions  
5. `apps/web/src/app/CLAUDE.md` — page specs and route map (contains detailed ASCII layout for game screen)
6. `apps/web/src/components/CLAUDE.md` — component tree and design rules
7. `apps/web/src/lib/CLAUDE.md` — core logic, decay engine specs, content generation, types
8. `packages/backend/CLAUDE.md` — Convex backend overview
9. `packages/backend/convex/CLAUDE.md` — schema and function specs

After reading ALL of these, create a plan to execute TASKS.md from Phase 0 through Phase 5 in order.

**Critical context:**
- This is a 24-HOUR HACKATHON. Speed matters. Don't over-engineer.
- The DECAY ENGINE (Phase 1) is the hero feature — it must look CINEMATIC, not broken.
- The DESIGN must NOT look like generic AI output. Follow the design system in root CLAUDE.md exactly: dark theme, Space Mono + Newsreader + DM Sans fonts, phosphor glow effects, terminal-panel aesthetics, CRT scanlines, asymmetric layouts.
- The game uses Convex for backend, Clerk for auth, and Claude API for content generation.
- Pre-generate cached content so the demo NEVER depends on live API calls.
- The game must be playable WITHOUT login (guest mode).
- Update TASKS.md checkboxes as you complete each task.
- Git commit after each task group (labeled in TASKS.md).

**Start with Phase 0: install dependencies, set up fonts, create the CSS custom properties, and build the design system foundation components (scanline overlay, noise texture, glow text, terminal panel). Then move to Phase 1: the decay engine.**

Begin.
